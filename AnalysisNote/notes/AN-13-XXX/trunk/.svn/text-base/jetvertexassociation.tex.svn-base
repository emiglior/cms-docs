\section{Association of the jets to the dilepton vertex}
\label{sec:jetvtx}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Jets not coming from the same proton-proton interaction
of the dilepton, e.g. originating from pileup (PU) vertices,  
are discarded using the variable $\beta$, the fraction of
the jet $p_T$ carried by the charged particle tracks in the jet coming 
from the same primary vertex (PV) as the dilepton, namely:
\[
\beta = \frac{  \displaystyle \sum_{i \in vtx,jet} p^{i}_{T}}{\displaystyle \sum_{j \in jet} p^{j}_{T}}
\]
where at the denominator the index $j$ runs on all the PF components of the
jet. 
In this analysis, the PV from which the dilepton originates is essentially always that
with the highest value of the $\sum p_{T,i}^2$.
In the data used for the analysis the mean of number of reconstructed
PV is \FIXME for the runs in 2011A and \FIXME for those in 2011B.
A sketch illustrating possible events coming from vertices of pileup is shown in Figure~\FIXME. 

For jets not coming from pileup events the $\beta$ variable follows,
over a wide range of values, to a good approximation, an exponential distribution function: 
\[
f(\beta) = \alpha~\exp^{\beta/\beta_0} .
\]
For very small $\beta$ the peak from pileup vertices dominates, while for
$\beta \rightarrow 1$ the distribution reaches a saturation.
We retain jets with $\beta>0.1$ and retain the event if there is at least one selected
jet. No fine optimization of this cut has been performed.

In order to compute the efficiency $\epsilon_{vtx}$ of retaining an event with a jet associated to the
dilepton PV, the distribution of the $\beta$ of the jet with the largest $\beta$ in the event
is analyzed separately for different PU multiplicities, from events
with exactly one reconstructed PV ($n_{PU}$=0) to events with twenty
  reconstructed PVs ($n_{PU}$=19). The distribution of the $\beta$
  variable for all the jets in events with a selected dimuon is shown
  in Figure~\ref{fig:betaAssoc_mmb} (left).

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

     with a selected dimuon: sum on on the pileup multiplicities

     events with four reconstructed PV (right).
     All the 2011 data sample is shown. 
   \label{fig:betaAssoc_mmb}} 
 \end{center}
\end{figure} 

For each distribution:
\begin{itemize}
\item the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta_{0}$ are determined from a
  fit in a fiducial region far both from saturation and
  from the peak of pileup events;
\item the cumulative distribution function from $\beta=0$ up to an upper
limit $\beta_{MAX}$, well below the saturation region, is evaluated analytically;
\item  the number of events in bins with $\beta_{MAX}<\beta<1$,
  indicated as $N^{\beta >\beta_{MAX}}_{DATA}$, is added.
\end{itemize}
\noindent An illustration of the fit for one specific pileup multiplicity is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:betaAssoc_mmb} (right).

The efficiency $\epsilon_{\beta}$ of retaining the event for a specific PV multiplicity
is computed as:
\[
\epsilon_{\beta} = \frac{\int_{0.1}^{\beta_{MAX}} f(\beta) + N^{\beta >\beta_{MAX}}_{DATA}}{\int_{0}^{\beta_{MAX}} f(\beta) + N^{\beta > \beta_{MAX}}_{DATA}  }
\]


The efficiency $\epsilon_{vtx}$ is then the weighted mean $\langle\beta \rangle$ of the efficiencies 
in the twenty PU bins:

\[
\epsilon_{vtx}=\langle \epsilon_{\beta} \rangle = \frac{\displaystyle
  \sum_{i=0}^{nPU} (\varepsilon^{i}_{\beta} 
  N^{i}_{DATA})}{\displaystyle \sum_{i=0}^{nPU} N^{i}_{DATA}}
\]

The background fraction is defined as all the data in excess to the exponential
in the fit region and in the bins of the histogram below the lower 
range of the fit.
