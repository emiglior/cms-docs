In this note we investigate the measurement of the ratio of the cross
section for the inclusive production of a $b$-jet in association with a
Z boson~\footnote{More precisely 
events are selected if there is a dimuon or a dilepton with an invariant 
mass in the range between 76 and 106 GeV. We refer to these dileptons as
"Z boson" but no attempt to separate the Z from the $\gamma^*$ component
is made in the analysis.}, defined as $Z+b$, to the cross section for
the inclusive production of a jet of any flavour in association with a
Z boson, defined as $Z+j$:
\[
{\mathcal R} = \frac{\sigma(pp \rightarrow Z+b+X)}{\sigma(pp
  \rightarrow Z+j+X)} .
\]
In the ratio ${\mathcal R}$ most of the experimental uncertainties cancel
out. Also the prediction is less sensitive to the choice
of the theory parameters like the set of PDF's and of the renormalization
and factorization scales.\\
The procedure for the selection of the events and for the extraction
of the cross sections described in this note follows closely the one 
described in the companion note~\cite{CMS_AN_2012-303}. In particular we use the
same data and simulation samples and apply the same reconstruction 
of the leptons and of the jets and the same kinematic cuts
on the $p_T$ and $\eta$ of these objects~(Table~\ref{tab:obj_selection_cuts}).
The main difference with respect to the main analysis is related to the
presence of pileup jets which could mimick a Z+jet event affecting in
a different way the $Z+b$ and the $Z+j$ rates. 
Therefore after the selection of a good dilepton candidate, performed
as in~\cite{CMS_AN_2012-303}, we retain only the jets reconstructed in the event 
associated to the dilepton vertex as detailed in the following
section. Then these jets have to pass the same kinematic cuts on the jets
as in~\cite{CMS_AN_2012-303} and finally out of them we select only
the events where at least one jet is classified as originating from a
b hadron according to the 'simple secondary vertex' (SSV) algorithm.
The selected dilepton mass range and the cut on the b-tagging discriminant are 
reported in Table~\ref{tab:evt_selection_cuts}.
The main results of this analysis are those obtained with the SSVHPT
selection. In the Appendix~\ref{app:ssvhem} results obtained with the SSVHEM selection
are reported for comparison.

The results described in this note are obtained with an integrated luminosity
of 5.21 fb$^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV  corresponding to the full 2011 sample of
proton-proton collisions.
