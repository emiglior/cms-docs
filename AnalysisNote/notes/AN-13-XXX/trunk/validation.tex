A detailed validation of the corrections and
of the smearing procedure for the 8 TeV samples was made by comparing the
position of the pole and the resolution extracted from the spectra of dimuons from
three reference resonances: J/$\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and Z. 
%Invariant mass spectra of the dimuon in 
%The models used to fit the resonances are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:fit_pdfs}.
Dimuon spectra were built in the $\eta$ and $p_T$ bins described in
Table~\ref{tab:eta_bins} and~\ref{tab:pt_bins} respectively. 
Spectra were filled if at least one muon fullfilled the
kinematic requirement, e.g. integrating over the kinematic of the
second muon.

Figure~\ref{fig:ScaleDATAMC_8TeV} shows the fractional difference of the fitted mass
\[
\frac{M_{DATA}-M_{MC}}{M_{DATA}}
\]
as function of $|\eta|$ and  $p_T$. For the Z, the agreement is
generally much better than 0.001 in all the $|\eta|$ and $p_T$ projections.
The largest deviations are observed in the J/$\psi$ for muons at large
$\eta$ and $p_T$. These deviations are anyway below 0.001 within the
statistical error from the fit to the resonance.
