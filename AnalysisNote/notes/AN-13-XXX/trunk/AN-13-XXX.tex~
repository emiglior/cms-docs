% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: External TeX parsers used on the abstract don't understand them.
\abstract{
This note describes the studies on the momentum scale and on the resolution
of the muons reconstructed by the CMS experiment in the 2011 and 2012
proton-proton runs using the MuScleFit algorithm.
Both real and simulated data were calibrated using the large sample
of dimuons decays from Z bosons. 
Validation of the results and an estimate of the systematic
uncertainty using dimuons from J/$\psi$, $\Upsilon(1S)$ and Z decays
for the data collected in 2012 is also presented.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
